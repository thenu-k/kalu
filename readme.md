#The What and the Why

This project is a record of my journey where I learn the inner workings of a frontend framework. I use frameworks like React and NextJS
all the time and while I understand the basics of how they work, I wanted to build one myself - and thus Kalu was born.

As Prof. Feynman so aptly said: "What I cannot create, I do not understand."
