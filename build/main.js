    When I use react and I create a JSX element, it's just a syntax sugar for React.createElement.
    In this project, I think I'll be creating a Kalu.createElemenet function but I don't know if I'll create
    my own syntactic sugar for it.
    When you install react, the actual react file is the babel that transpiles the JSX into React.createElement.
    It's react-dom that actually renders the element.

    An site that I came across advices me to learn the following:
    - createElement Function
    - render Function
    - Concurrent Mode
    - Fibers (Layman's understanding of what this is at the moment)
    - Render and Commit Phases
    - Reconciliation
    - Functional Components
    - Hooks

class Kalu {
    createElement(type, props, ...children) {
        hello;
    }
}
